# Temporary EPA Day-of-Week Filtering

## Overview
This document describes the **TEMPORARY** implementation of day-of-week EPA filtering for assessments, implemented per customer MVP request.

## What Was Changed
Only **one file** was modified: `shiftnotes-mobile/components/assessments/NewAssessmentForm.tsx`

### Changes Made:

1. **Added hardcoded EPA day-of-week mapping** (lines 85-109)
   - Maps each day of the week (0=Sunday to 6=Saturday) to allowed EPA numbers
   - Based on customer-provided CSV mapping
   - Includes helper function `getEpaNumber()` to extract EPA numbers from codes

2. **Modified `getAvailableEpas()` function** (lines 310-333)
   - Now checks the selected shift date
   - Filters EPAs based on day of week before filtering out already-selected EPAs
   - If no shift date is selected, shows all EPAs (no filtering)

3. **Added UI helper message** (lines 819-823)
   - Shows a blue italicized message when shift date is selected
   - Informs users: "ðŸ“… Available EPAs are filtered based on the shift date's day of week"

4. **Added helper text style** (lines 1212-1217)
   - Styling for the informational message

## How It Works

1. User selects a shift date in the New Assessment form
2. The system calculates the day of week (JavaScript's `Date.getDay()`: 0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)
3. EPAs are filtered to only show those allowed for that specific day
4. User can only select from the filtered EPA list
5. When editing an existing assessment, already-selected EPAs remain visible even if they don't match the day filter

## EPA Day Mapping (From CSV)

| Day       | Available EPAs |
|-----------|----------------|
| Sunday    | 2, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 |
| Monday    | 7, 9, 14, 16, 20, 21, 22 |
| Tuesday   | 2, 4, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 |
| Wednesday | 2, 5, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 22 |
| Thursday  | 2, 3, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 22 |
| Friday    | 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 22 |
| Saturday  | 1, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 22 |

## Why This Approach?

âœ… **No database changes** - entirely frontend logic  
âœ… **Easy to remove** - all code marked with clear TEMPORARY comments  
âœ… **No data structure changes** - assessments can still have any EPA  
âœ… **Backend agnostic** - backend doesn't need to know about this rule  
âœ… **Simple to maintain** - all logic in one place  

## How to Remove Later

When ready to remove this temporary feature:

1. Search for `TEMPORARY` in `NewAssessmentForm.tsx`
2. Remove lines 85-109 (the mapping and helper function)
3. Replace `getAvailableEpas()` function (lines 310-333) with the original:
   ```typescript
   const getAvailableEpas = () => {
     const selectedEpaIds = new Set(assessmentSlots.map(s => s.epaId).filter(Boolean));
     return epas.filter(epa => !selectedEpaIds.has(epa.id));
   };
   ```
4. Remove the helper message (lines 819-823)
5. Remove the helperText style (lines 1212-1217) - optional, can keep for future use

All changes are in ONE file, making removal very straightforward.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Select different shift dates and verify EPA list changes accordingly
- [ ] Verify Sunday shows only EPAs: 2, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
- [ ] Verify Monday shows only EPAs: 7, 9, 14, 16, 20, 21, 22
- [ ] Verify existing assessments can be edited (already-selected EPAs remain)
- [ ] Verify the helper message appears when shift date is selected
- [ ] Test on both web and mobile platforms

## Notes

- The filtering is **case-insensitive** for EPA codes (handles "EPA 1", "EPA1", "epa 1", etc.)
- If EPA code format changes, the `getEpaNumber()` regex may need adjustment
- Frontend-only solution means assessments can technically still have "wrong day" EPAs if created before this feature or via API directly (by design - no backend validation)
