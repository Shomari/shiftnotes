# Program-Level Data Isolation - Implementation Complete âœ“

## Summary
Successfully implemented **strict program-level data isolation** across the entire ShiftNotes application. The app now enforces complete separation of data between programs, with no exceptions.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Removed ALL Cross-Program Access in the App**
- Removed all `is_superuser` checks from ViewSets
- Removed all special privileges for 'system-admin' role
- The app is now 100% program-scoped for ALL users

### 2. **Simple, Consistent Security Model**
Every ViewSet now uses this simple pattern:
```python
def get_queryset(self):
    """Filter to only show data from the user's program"""
    if self.request.user.program:
        return Model.objects.filter(program=self.request.user.program)
    return Model.objects.none()
```

### 3. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **Mobile/Web App**: 100% program-scoped, no exceptions
- **Django Admin Console**: For cofounder-level system administration only

5. **`shiftnotes-backend/analytics/views.py`**
   - competency_grid_data: Removed superuser checks

6. **`shiftnotes-backend/users/password_reset_views.py`**
   - trigger_password_reset: Removed superuser/system-admin checks

## Security Model

### App Access (Mobile/Web)
**Everyone sees ONLY their program's data:**
- âœ… Admin (Program Coordinators)
- âœ… Leadership
- âœ… Faculty
- âœ… Trainees
- âœ… Even superusers when using the app

### Django Admin Console
- ðŸ”§ Cofounders access this directly for system administration
- ðŸ”§ Used for cross-program operations, database management
- ðŸ”§ Never accessed through the mobile/web app

## What This Means

### For Users
- **Program A** cannot see anything from **Program B**
- Even if both programs are in the same organization
- Complete data privacy and isolation

### For Admins/Coordinators
- Can manage their entire program
- Cannot see or access other programs
- No special backdoors or exceptions

### For Cofounders
- Use Django admin console for system-level work
- When using the app, restricted to program like everyone else
- Clean separation of operational and administrative access

## Testing Checklist

After deploying, verify:

1. **âœ“ Program Isolation**
   - Log in as admin from Program A
   - Confirm you see ONLY Program A users, EPAs, assessments, etc.
   - Create users in Program B
   - Log in as Program B admin
   - Confirm you see ONLY Program B data

2. **âœ“ Organization Isolation**
   - Log in as admin from Organization X
   - Confirm you cannot see anything from Organization Y

3. **âœ“ Superuser Limitation**
   - Log in as superuser through the app
   - Confirm you ONLY see your program's data
   - Confirm cross-program access does NOT work in app
   - Confirm cross-program access DOES work in Django admin console

## Deployment

1. **Backend**: Restart Django server to apply ViewSet changes
2. **No migrations needed**: All changes are application-layer only
3. **No data changes**: Existing data is unaffected
4. **Immediate effect**: Takes effect as soon as backend restarts

## Benefits

1. **Security**: True multi-tenancy at program level
2. **Simplicity**: No complex permission logic or special cases
3. **Clarity**: Every user follows the same rules
4. **Maintainability**: Consistent pattern across all ViewSets
5. **Scalability**: Can safely add unlimited programs without data leakage concerns

## Future Considerations

1. Consider removing 'system-admin' role from ROLE_CHOICES in models (currently exists but unused)
2. Consider adding audit logging for Django admin console access
3. Consider adding unit tests to verify program isolation across all endpoints
